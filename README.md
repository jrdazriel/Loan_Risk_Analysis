# Loan_Risk_Analysis
Loan risk analysis of a dataset containing about 2.2m rows and 145 features on lending club loans from 2007 to 2018...

In the DataCleaning.ipynb file we work our way into a reasonably smaller dataset that we can use to make our predictions

In Model_and_results.ipynb we try about 5 different models and we gain some valuable insights from these on what our data is doing for us.

Some next steps I would like to work on:
* We can tweak penalties further and try to implement a gridsearch optimization to find the best penalties
* potentially try some additional models and maybe even something custom or more advanced
* Generate better features with some of the discarded columns(such as maybe emp_title)
* use some ensembling techniques for multiple models to potentially increase our accuracy on predictions
* apply some hyperparameter tuning for more performance
